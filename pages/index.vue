        What is a focus session?

      <div class="pb-5 pa-2 fs-5 fw-3 text-white">
        Focus sessions are a way to optimize your time, and increase
        productivity.
        <br />
        <br />
        When starting a session, you will have
        <span class="text-tertiary-tint-5">25 minutes to focus</span>
        on a task and
        <span class="text-tertiary-tint-5">5 minutes to relax</span>
        .
        <br />
        <br />
        You can skip breaks if you are really focused, and use it later.
        <br />
        Skipping a 5-minute break means you'll have a 10-minute break on the
        next break.

          <li class="pa-3">
            When you start a session, Flock will generate a random task for you
            to do (based on its priority).

            When the 25-minute session is done, Flock will let you have a

            When the 5-minute session is done, Flock will generate another
